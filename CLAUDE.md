# Instructions for Claude

- On every coding task, apply the `ponytail` skill (level: full) automatically, without being asked.
- Before finishing any change, run a `ponytail-review` pass on your own diff and apply the cuts it finds (never removing validation, error handling, security, or accessibility).
- Run `ponytail-audit` only when explicitly asked.
